## ❓ ANSWERING SETUP QUESTIONS (Post-delivery support)

### Question: "How do I install?"
```
Hi [CLIENT_NAME],

To install:

1. Make sure Python 3.8+ is installed
2. Extract the ZIP file
3. Open terminal/command prompt in that folder
4. Run: pip install -r requirements.txt

That's it! Then follow the README.md usage section.

Let me know if you hit any issues.

Best regards,
Warshawski
```

### Question: "Can you explain the results?"
```
Hi [CLIENT_NAME],

Here's what the metrics mean:

• Total Return: Overall profit/loss percentage over the backtest period
• Win Rate: Percentage of profitable trades (yours is [X]%, which is [good/average/excellent])
• Max Drawdown: Largest peak-to-trough decline ([X]% means you'd see that max loss from peak)
• Sharpe Ratio: Risk-adjusted returns ([X] is [below 1 = risky / 1-2 = good / 2+ = excellent])

Your strategy had [X] trades over [Y] months, which is [description based on numbers].

[Add any specific insights about their strategy]

Let me know if you need anything else clarified!

Best regards,
Warshawski
```

### Question: "How do I modify parameters?"
```
Hi [CLIENT_NAME],

To modify parameters:

1. Open config.json
2. Find the "strategy" → "parameters" section
3. Change values (e.g., "rsi_period": 14 to "rsi_period": 20)
4. Save and run again

The README.md has a "Customization" section with examples.

Note: Changing parameters will change performance. Test thoroughly before live trading.

Best regards,
Warshawski
```

### Question: "Can you add [feature]?"
```
Hi [CLIENT_NAME],

That modification would require additional development work.

I'd be happy to help! This would be a new order:
[Estimate based on complexity: $50-200]

Alternatively, the code is fully commented - you can modify the generate_signals() method in strategy.py to add your logic.

Let me know what you'd prefer!

Best regards,
Warshawski

## 🎁 BONUS: UPSELL MESSAGES (After successful delivery)

### Suggesting optimization (if they ordered Basic)
```
Hi [CLIENT_NAME],

Glad the strategy is working for you!

Quick note: The current version uses default parameters. If you're interested, I offer parameter optimization that could potentially improve performance by [10-30%].

This would involve testing 100+ parameter combinations to find the optimal settings for your specific symbols and timeframe.

Let me know if you'd like a quote!

Best regards,
Warshawski
```

### Suggesting live trading setup (if they ordered Standard)
```

Best regards,
Warshawski

## 🚫 HANDLING OUT-OF-SCOPE REQUESTS

```
Hi [CLIENT_NAME],

That would be outside the scope of the current order, but I'd be happy to help!

For [request description], I'd need to:
• [WORK 1]
• [WORK 2]
• [WORK 3]

This would be approximately [X] hours of work, which would be a new order of [estimate $X-Y].

Alternatively, if you want to handle it yourself, I can point you to the relevant code sections and documentation.

Let me know what works best!

Best regards,
Warshawski
